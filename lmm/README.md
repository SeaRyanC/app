## LMM - Label Mail Merge

A browser-based tool for creating printable labels from address data. Paste CSV or TSV data containing names, addresses, or any other information, design a label template using placeholders, and generate a PDF ready for printing on standard Avery label sheets or custom paper formats.

The app supports 30+ paper formats including popular Avery templates for both US Letter and A4 paper sizes. Labels can be customized with Markdown formatting (bold, italic, underline), adjustable font size, alignment options, and optional cut marks or borders for testing alignment. All settings are saved to localStorage, so your work persists across browser sessions.
