## Pix - Pixel Image Extractor

Pix extracts clean, pixel-perfect images from roughly drawn pixel art. When you have pixel art that's been scaled up, has misaligned pixels, or contains noise, Pix helps you recover the original grid and export a crisp result.

Load an image by pasting, dragging, or uploading. Click on the image to identify regions of similar color—Pix will analyze the shape and help you build up a map of the pixel grid. Once four or more regions are defined, the tool infers the overall grid alignment and generates a preview of the extracted pixel art.

The output can be refined with optional transparency inference (detecting background colors that should be transparent) and color limiting (reducing the palette to a specified number of colors). Export the result to your clipboard or as a PNG file.
